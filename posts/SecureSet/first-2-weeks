	<h3>Systems Foundations</h3>
	<p>
		"This was the beginning of our journey into Cyber Security. We talked about basic system information, such as how to navigate the Windows GUI on Windows 10 and we started to touch into the Linux Operating System. Most of our work was done in a Linux terminal so we were encouraged to use the Command Line Interface (CLI) as much as possible. I had a lot of fun poking around the Linux CLI and figuring how things worked. It was great practice!"
	</p>
	<br />
	<h3>Network Foundations</h3>
	<p>
		"This was the beginning of our network cram. This class was quite challenging for all of us."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Our first hurdle was figuring out the Wireshark tool. We had to capture packets and then examine and follow them. It was interesting but we lost sight of why we capturing packets."
	</p>
	<p>
		"It wasn't until we started going over the OSI Model did it start to make sense. We started seeing the patterns in the packet captures fairly quickly."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Once we started feeling confident with the packet captures, <b>a lab was thrown at us that almost made me quit</b>"
	</p>
	<p>
		"The lab required us to have two virtual machines running on their own isolated networks. Our goal was to use a local proxy to log into once VM from another using SecureShell (SSH). Below is a small diagram of what was required of us:"

	<p>
		"From our very limited knowledge, we had no idea how to accomplish this. In the picture, there is a pre-configured proxy but we needed to do the configuration on our side! Wow. Seemed easy once we figured it out, it just took a lot of brain power and head banging on the desks."
